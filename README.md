# Milestone one

## 2 Project State
Currently we implemented our scraper for the german twitter trends and our pipeline. 
We were not able to finish the machine learning part and the website where we will present our results.
In the second part of the project we want to finish the machine learning part and hope to get started with the website.

In our pipeline we firstly cleand our data form all non alphabetical characters. Secondlyt we used the CountVectorizer from sklearn to remove the stopwords and set all letters to their lowercased form. Thirdly we tokenized it all and 
listend to the suggestions from our tutor and only used lemmatization.
